This file demonstrated very briefly usage of WKBeam in hydra supercomputer. 


This folder contains three sample batch script files for running WKBeam on hydra. Hydra queue system 
contains various queues depending on the number of cores and time requested by the user. The queues 
can be listed by 'llclass' -command. In this folder, we present three examples of using different 
queues varying from one core/one node up to 1280 cores. The files are:

hydra.cmd: suitable for massive simulations, this example uses 1280 cores and books them for 24 hours
hydra_testing.cmd: from the opposite end of the spectrum, books one node/20 cores for 30 minutes
hydra_binning.cmd: since running interactive jobs is forbidden, you have to bin the results using a batch 
script. This example bins using one node/one core 

When you have modified one of the .cmd files to suite your usage, submit the job to the queue by commanding
'llsubmit yourscript.cmd'. You can monitor the queue by 'llq' or your own jobs by 'llq |grep username' or 
your own queue by 'llq | grep queuename'. Queue names are listed in the first column of llclass command.
