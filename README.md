# WKBacca_QL/Development/WKBacca_streamlined

## Description

Streamlined branch with no output files, meant to be uploaded to spcsv26 with the fewest amount of add-on files, but just to be run on that server.

### Added files

WKBacca cases - Some TCV cases to be studied, with all the setup files in place.
QL_bounce_calc_LUKE - The cactual QL diffusion calculation file, with optional outputs and so on. Meant to be used through a script!
